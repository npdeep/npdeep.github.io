This time, he is competing head-to-head against fellow bowler Fosse. However, rather than knocking down 10 pins arranged in a triangular formation, they are trying to knock down $N^2$ pins (where $N$ is some very, very large number) arranged in a rhombus, as shown below:\nWhen Magritte rolls, he always knocks down the topmost pin. Then, if any pin gets knocked down, it has a 50 percent chance of knocking down either of the two pins directly behind it, independently of each other. (If there is only one pin directly behind it, then it too has a 50 percent chance of being knocked over.)\nFosse is a stronger bowler than Magritte. Like Magritte, she always knocks down the topmost pin. But each pin that’s knocked down then has a 70 percent chance (rather than Magritte’s 50 percent) of knocking down any of the pins directly behind it.\nWhat are Magritte’s and Fosse’s respective probabilities of knocking down the bottommost pin in the rhombus formation?\nI tried deriving a recursive relation between probabilities of pins being knocked out layer by layer. This approach wasn’t very fruitful. The solutions I was getting would take too long to compute.\nIt took me a while to realize that you can reduce this problem to that of finding a directed path in a random-bond square lattice.\nIn a square lattice with $N^2$ vertices, we randomly sample edges. Any two nearest neighboring vertices are connected with probability $p$. In terms of bowling pins, two vertices (or pins) are connected if knocking the first pin knocks the second pin too. The last pin gets knocked if there is exists a continguous and directed path (since we cannot travel back in time) between the first pin and the last.\nThis sounds like something that should be probably is well-studied.
