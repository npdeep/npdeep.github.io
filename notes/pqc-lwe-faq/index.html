But, this paper was special. It spread like wildfire and I did finally get around to reading it. Well, I have been using the term ‘reading’ liberally these days. What I mean is I opened a browser tab, read the first few pages and the last few paragraphs, highlighted a few words here and there, and I followed some Twitter reactions to it.\nHere are some frequently and infrequently asked questions.\nWhy do people care about this work? By now, it is common knowledge that quantum algorithms can break cyptography algorithms whose hardness derives from prime factoring or calculating discrete log. In response, cryptographers have been working towards “post-quantum” cryptography (PQC), supposedly robust against quantum attacks. For example, NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology) has been working for a while to come up with federally approved standards on post-quantum cryptography. These new crypto algorithms are often built around a family of problems called ’lattice problems’ – over the next few months, you might hear terms like GapSVP, and SIVP, which are all examples of lattice problems. I won’t get into the details because life is better without knowing all these things.\nWhat does this paper do to such post-quantum cryptography? The paper specifically solves a problem called Learning with Errors (LWE), which can then be used to solve certain lattice problems, which in turn make up the backbone of post-quantum algorithms like CRYSTALKyber. The paper claims to solve the LWE problem in polynomial time, which, if the paper is true, would open up new vulnerabilities in post-quantum cryptography.\nIs it good news or bad news? For me and other researchers, it’s great news! It adds to the urgency and relevance of the kinds of things we study. But, if you are in the business which depends on LWE being exponentially difficult to solve, then probably not so great news for you.\nThat sounds like a big deal? Yes, but only if the paper is true and correct, and the jury is still out on that, or so I hear. I don’t understand the field well enough to have a reliable knee-jerk reaction to this paper, plus the paper is sixty four pages long and uses words like “Karst waves” and “Gaussians.”\nI heard NIST has some candidate post-quantum crypto algoritms? Are they vulnerable too? Interestingly, even if the paper is true, it doesn’t quite break NIST Post-Quantum candidates; the paper just barely falls short. But, this increases the likelihood that more follow-up work on the subject will eventually take us there.\nIs there a business angle here? Can I maybe do a startup based on this paper? There is always a business angle, my friend.\nWill I be personally affected by it? No one currently has a working quantum computer, and a device that can solve LWE is very very far away. So I would say, you are good. Unless you are the type to be driven into existential despair by cryptographic falliabilities.\nApril 13, 2024\n","wordCount":"535","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-04-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-04-13T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pradeepniroula.com/notes/pqc-lwe-faq/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bits \u0026 Qubits","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pradeepniroula.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/ accesskey=h title="Bits & Qubits (Alt + H)">Bits & Qubits</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sozxaMYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" title=Research><span>Research</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/reviews/ title=Briefs><span>Briefs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/notes/ title=Notes><span>Notes</span></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/writings/ title=Writings><span>Writings</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Is Post-Quantum Crypto Broken?
