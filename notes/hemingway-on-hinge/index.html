The film center there, which I am a member of, had a small mixer for its members followed by a screening of Black Swan.\nIt was a very pleasant day, and the invite came with a complimentary foodtruck snack. I grabbed a helping of fried mac and cheese bites and sat on a bench under treeshade. Not long after, I was joined by a woman in a very elegant, flowing blue dress; she sat on the other end of the bench. We got into a conversation. She was as new to New York as me. Before this, she was in Cleveland, she says. I had never been, I admitted.\n“Not much there, she said, that’s why I moved.”\nWhy New York, I asked She said she wanted a change. She went through a divorce last year and wanted a change of scene, and she had always longed to experience the New York life she had heard about so much.\n“Well, how has it been?”\n“It’s gooood”, she says with stretching the word like mozarella cheese, “Lots of fun people here.”\n“Have you found anyone?”\n“Oh, plenty,” she laughs and I myself feel a blush rising.\nShe then asks me where was I before New York. I tell her I was in DC. She then asks me what I missed about DC, if I missed anything at all? I told her I used to sail in DC and I haven’t had the chance to do that yet in New York.\n“Actually, this guy I just met on a dating app. He is a big sailor. Fishes a lot too. And, also a writer. I think you might like him.”\n“Sounds like an interesting person, for sure.”\n“His name is Ernest, splits his time between Cuba and SoHo. We might be meeting up sometime this weekend?”\nI don’t inquire any further.\n“You want to see a picture of him. Look. There is one with his cat, isn’t he just adorable?”\nAnd there was a smiling man with a magnificient mustache, sitting in a stately pose, with a cat on his lap.\n“Adorable, yes.”\nWait a second, I thought. This looks familiar. Why did this man look familiar? No. That can’t be.\n“Ma’am, do you know his last name?”\n“No. His profile only has his first name. Quite an odd question to ask someone before meeting them no?”\n“Can you show me his full dating profile?”\n“Sure. Here it is:”\n“That’s quite a catch you got there,” I said\n“Ahhh, fishing joke. I get it,” she returns her phone carefully into her purse.\n","wordCount":"453","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-06-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-06-14T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pradeepniroula.com/notes/hemingway-on-hinge/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bits \u0026 Qubits","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pradeepniroula.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/ accesskey=h title="Bits & Qubits (Alt + H)">Bits & Qubits</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sozxaMYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" title=Research><span>Research</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/reviews/ title=Briefs><span>Briefs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/notes/ title=Notes><span>Notes</span></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/writings/ title=Writings><span>Writings</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Hemingway on Hinge</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-06-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 14, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>A couple of days back, I was at a summer event at the Lincoln Center in the Upper West Side of New York.
