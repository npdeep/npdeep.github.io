Moderator: On my left, looking sleek and calm, we have classical computer.\nClassical Computer: Hola!\nModerator: On my right, looking frazzled and overworked, we have a quantum computer.\nQuantum Computer: Howdy folks!\nModerator: I will let Classical Computer take the floor.\nClassical Computer: Thank you, moderator. This man, this quantum computer as he calls himself, cannot even do some very simple things that I can do easily. Let me demonstrate. Dear Quantum Computer, can you run Excel?\nQuantum Computer: Umm, no.\nClassical Computer: Can you send an email?\nQuantum Computer: Umm, no. Dude, you know I can’t use the internet. Ask me other things.\nClassical Computer: Okay, something simple then. If I give you a large number, say 1007, can you give me its prime factors?\nQuantum Computer: Well, I cannot. Not right now.\nClassical Computer: So what can you do really? Can you add two numbers? Can you add 15 to 27?\nQuantum Computer: (embarrassed) No.\nClassical Computer: Ladies and Gentlemen, as you can see, the quantum computer is truly incapable of doing even the most elementary things. How can it even lay claim to supremacy when everything the quantum computer can do, I could do better? I call this debate settled!\nQuantum Computer: HOLD ON A SECOND!!\nModerator: Ladies and Gentlement, Quantum Computer is visibly outraged.\nQuantum Computer: The debate IS CERTAINLY not settled. Ladies and Gentlemen, this man is using a unfair line of questioning, asking me to do things that it knows I am not designed for. Yes, I am not designed for emails, nor playing games, not running Excel. Moderator, could you clarify something for me?\nModerator: Certainly.\nQuantum Computer: My opponent just said that he can do everything I can do, but better. To win this debate, is it enough for me to show that there is at least one job that I can do but my opponent cannot?\nModerator: Ehhhh, let me look at the rules. Yes, that would be enough, under the terms of this debate.\nQuantum Computer: Okay give me a second. Let me fetch something.\nModerator: (Uh oh) Quantum computer seems to be pulling something out of his backpack. What is he grabbling? Uh oh, he has just pulled out A BUNCH OF QUANTUM PROGRAMS!! HOLY SHIT!\nQuantum Computer: These are quantum programs, made specifically for me by my manufacturer. Each of these programs does not give a single result, but it produces a probability distribution on numbers. When I run this quantum program, I can sample randomly from that distribution. Now I challenge my opponent to run these programs and sample from their distributions.\nClassical Computer: This is not fair.\nQuantum Computer: Oh? Is it not? Let’s start with the easiest. (takes the smallest quantum program) Let me run it right now. (produces a list of numbers two seconds later). Okay look, here is the list of numbers corresponding to the program I just ran. Moderator, could you verify that the numbers do indeed come from the distribution induced by the program I just executed?\nModerator: Give me a minute. (a few moments later) Indeed, the numbers on this list appear to be mostly drawn from the right distribution.\nQuantum Computer: Now, classical computer. I dare you to run the same program.\nClassical Computer: (takes the quantum program, turns it around a few times and executes it. After a few minutes, it finishes the job.) I admit it wasn’t easy, but it looks like I can do it. Here is my list. Moderator, can you check if my numbers are as good as the quantum computer’s?\nModerator: Actually, these numbers are excellent. Classical computer seems to have done the task as well as the quantum computer. He might have even done it better.\nQuantum Computer: That’s because I was going easy on him. Let’s now move on to the bigger quantum program. I can run this big quantum program just as easily as I can run the small program. (two seconds later). Here are the numbers corresponding to the new program. Moderator, do check if it looks right.\nModerator: Looks good to me. They aren’t as perfect as the last time, but still decent. Now, Classical Computer, can you do better?\nCLassical Computer: (sweating) I am not sure if I can run the bigger program.\nModerator: If you don’t try, you will forfeit the competition.\nQuantum Computer: Come on Classical Computer, at least give it a try. Would be a pity if you gave up so easily.\nThe classical computer reluctantly takes the large quantum program, and tries to run it. Ten minutes later, the classical computer is sweating and quivering. An hour later, he is close to breaking down.\nClassical Computer: I CANNOT DO THIS!! I GIVE UP!\nQuantum Computer: Well, well, well. It only took you an hour to give up.\nClassical Computer: These programs are too difficult for me, it would take me years to sample from these programs. But this is grave injustice. These programs don’t even do anything useful, they just produce a bunch of random numbers.\nQuantum Computer: This whole debate is not about doing useful things, is it Moderator?\nModerator: No. The quantum computer is right. As long as the tasks can be defined accurately, they can be absolutely meaningless.\nQuantum Computer: That’s right. The tasks can be meaningless. And, that ladies and gentlemen, proves that there are indeed tasks that I can do that my opponent cannot. I have therefore attained quantum supremacy.\nModerator: Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe we have a winner. Quantum Computer has successfully demonstrated an existence of a task, however pointless, that a classical computer cannot do quickly.\nClassical Computer: (whimpering) Every time I send an email or run Excel, I attain classical supremacy. Everytime I do something useful, I attain classical supremacy.\nModerator: The rules are straightforward: the clear, obvious, undisputed winner is the quantm computer. Now, we will let the New York Times cover this story.\n","wordCount":"1015","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-12-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-12-16T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pradeepniroula.com/notes/supremacy-debate-rcs/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bits \u0026 Qubits","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pradeepniroula.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/ accesskey=h title="Bits & Qubits (Alt + H)">Bits & Qubits</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sozxaMYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" title=Research><span>Research</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/reviews/ title=Briefs><span>Briefs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/notes/ title=Notes><span>Notes</span></a></li><li><a href=https://pradeepniroula.com/writings/ title=Writings><span>Writings</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Supremacy Debates: A Transcript</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 16, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Moderator: Welcome to another edition of Supremacy Debates, where we have a quantum computer go against a classical computer to determine who is better.
